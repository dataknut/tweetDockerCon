# tweetDockerCon17
As well as building a [live #dockerCon tweet monitor](https://finnian.io/blog/tweetdock-at-dockercon/) we thought we'd do a bit of visualisation of tweeting behaviour over DockerCon17 April 17-21, 2017.

To do this we are collecting &amp; visualising #dockercon tweets for the entire week, saving them to an archive and then running them through some R processing & analysis code. The chart below is a simple visualisation of the tweetFlow (TM :-) of tweets and re-tweets on Day 1 with the first keynote session 'grey-lighted'.

For full results (to date) which include all days, more days, tweeing locations and visualisations of tweetStreaks by the most prolific tweeters see:

 * Latest [results](tweetDockerCon.html) - be careful, some of the inline charts are quite big
 * [Code](https://github.com/dataknut/tweetDockerCon)
 
To make comments or analysis requests, raise an issue. I can't guarantee to respond but it's worth a go.

Or better still, fork & DIY :-)
